Description: Provides a Shiny App to analyze datasets in the framework of
    classical test theory by providing wrapper functions for the lavaan
    package. Most importantly, the main function rigorously checks the model
    assumptions of the 5 CTT models in decreasing order of complexity
    (tau-kongeneric, essentially tau-equivalent, tau-equivalent and essentially
    tau-parallel, and tau-parallel) and adjusts its reliability estimators
    accordingly. Moreover, it provides standard errors and confidence intervals
    for all parameters, including item reliabilities and error variances.
